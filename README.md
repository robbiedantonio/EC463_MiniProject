# EC463_MiniProject
Software mini project for ENG EC463 Senior Design

In this project, we developed a Realtime Chat App using React Native and Firebase. This application offers users an engaging chat application for both Android and iOS users. We began by designing an intuitive user interface. Our first step was to offer users the seamless option to either log in or sign up for the application using their email, making use of Firebase's backend services. To enable real-time messaging, we seamlessly integrated Firebase, ensuring that messages are delivered instantly between users. To accomplish our goal, we relied on a variety of sources, with our primary source of guidance being a YouTube tutorial. You can find the tutorial we used by following this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov3Z3vD5zFw.
